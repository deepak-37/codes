=============
1. In our organization, we are following these kinds of strategies for deployment.
2.  Thera are 2 types of deployment strategies:
        a)recreate deployment.
        b) rollout deployment.
---> recreate depoyment is the simplest deployment strategy
----> for suppose ver.1 of the app is deployed and we have ver.2 to be deployed.
---->In this case ver1 will be deleted /terminated and ver2 will be deployed.
----> In this strategy, there will be  a down time.

----->rollout deployment is one of the deployment strategy.
-----> In this strategy, in ver1, there are 50 machines and In ver2, there is 50 machines.
-----> first in ver2, we will deploy 10 machines and In ver1 we will delete/terminate 10 machines.
-----> In this deployment strategy there is no downtime and there will be no impact to the end-users.
-----> In this case, ver1 which is old considered as blue and ver2 which is the latest one willl be considered as green
