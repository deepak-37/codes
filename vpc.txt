private
in a region
in all az
large network 
so it divided into smaller groups called subnets
why
cloud privacy&security 
extra layer security ease of 
default vpc & customised vpc
default is created by aws
pre configured
custom non default
we have to create subnet,nat,security group,igw etc.,
ip address
unique entity to each device in a network 
used to locate the host in network 
through networkid & host id present in ip address
xxx.xx.xx.xx.xx/16
4 pats octate
8 bits
32 bits
cidr
class lesss inter domain routing
cidr range 
represent ip address
ex:
172.31.0.0/16
16:no of bits 
8/8/8/8
in those 32...16 are occupied 
16 are remaining 2 to the power 16 ip's are availabe
key components of vpc
igw and nat:routing of traffic in pub network
dns:names used over internet into ip address
elastic ip:ip never changes
vpc end point:private connection betweem vpc and other aws services without internet
network interface:point of connection between public and private network
egress only IG:outbund communication from ec2 over ipv6
route tables:how traffic routed between each subnet
vpc peering:connection between vpc
subnets:
it is logical sub division of large network
ip's with common prefix are same subnet
ex:devices with ip address starting from 172.31.
private/public
private not exposed to world
uses only private ip
backend applications 
public
exposed through internet
make use of public and private external facing applications like webserver
ex 
facebook bifurcation 

hands on
vpc name :devps
cidr:10.0.0.0/16
subnets :1 public + 1 private 
seperate availability zones
igw 1
route tables: 1 in public subnet
security groups :2
nat gateway :1 


route tables:where the network traffic has to be routed 
it specifies the destination subnet (prefix) and gateway/router to reach it

internet gateway
public subnet needs to communicate over the internet 

instance needs have internet access ..global ip and relevant sg'same
rt of subnet in which instance is present must point to igw
subnet attached to igw is called public subnet

natnetwork address translation
it enables instances in private subnet to access internet or
 other aws resources but prevent internet from initiating connections to the instance
 2 way communication
 in sufficient for hackers
 for security and economy

 security groups
 stateful
 only allow rules
 fire wall at instace level
 control inbound and out bound trafic for instance

 nacl
 subnet level security 
 both allow and deny rulesfor subnet

 nacl stateless
 defined per subnet

 vpc peering 
vpc to vpc via direct network route
initiate peering requests
accept peering requests
create routes
vpn
vpc to data center  through IPS internet prtocol security protocol 
direct connect
