Requesting the SSL certificate:
================================

* For routing the traffic HTTP to HTTPS, we need an SSL(secure socket layer) certificate

* In  AWS, We have the service, where you will get an SSL certificate

* The service name is called, ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)

* In ACM, you have to request the certificate for your registered domain 

* when you are entering your domain, you should enter it like this ” *.domain.name”

* After requesting the certificate, it is in a pending state

* For approval, you have to create a record, in the ACM only, you will get the option to create a record

* After the creation of the record, just refresh the page once, your SSL certificate will get verified

Attach SSL certificate
========================

* To attach the SSL certificate, we need a load balancer

* Internally, we attach to the Listeners

* In the Listener, we will go with host_based rule----because we are accessing with domain name

* As all of us knows, when we are creating the Load Balancer, we will get one default listener

*Firstly, the request will come with HTTP(insecure) to the listener, and later we have to redirect to the HTTPS(secure). Here, you have to attach your SSL certificate

* Then Add the new Listener

* In the new Listener, we have to forward the request to the Target group

* In the Target Group, we will attach a group of Ec2’s

* Clear the cache memory and history of the browser 

* Then access with your domain record, your request will come to HTTPS protocol
