vpc endpoint:
============================
VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your vpc to the supported aws services.
Instances in your vpc don't  require public ip addresses to communicate with the resources in the service.
Endpoints are virtual devices which enables  the option to connect to the aws serivces within aws.

steps:
-----------
create own vpc with the cidr ------> 10.0.0.0/16
create two subnets -----------------> pub-subnet-1----->10.0.0.0/24
				   priv-subnet-1------>10.0.1.0/24

create one igw and attach it to the own vpc.

create route table , route table name: route-1, select own vpc and create route table.
select created route table---->go on to the router ---edit routes-----0.0.0.0./0-------igw.
and go on to the subnet associations and select public subnet to provide internet to it.

create two ec2's:
one in public subnet ----select my vpc, public subnet, enable auto-assing public ip while launching the public ec2.
one in private subeet----select my vpc, private subnet, disable auto-assign public ip .
sg----must be 22-myip to connect and 22-anywhere.

create endpoint ---select aws services-------select the one ending with s3 ----with --gateway (type).
----> select ownvpc
----->select private subnet.
------>create endpoint.

then connect to the public ec2 
sudo su -
vi anypemfile.pem
just provide permissions to connect to the private ec2 like chmod 700 anypemfile.pem
then connect to the private subnet using command :    ssh -i anypemfile.pem ec2-user@private ip of private ec2.

create a role and attach it to the private subnet to access the content of s3.
after connecting to the private subnet 
sudo su -
aws s3 ls (to get list of buckets of s3)
aws s3 mb s3://newbucketname   (to make bucket in s3)
aws s3 rb s3://newbucketname     (to remove bucket in s3)
