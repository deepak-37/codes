Moving no of files into one directory:
======================================
Mv filename1 Directoryname
Mv filename1 filename2 directoryname
Mv -uvi ------------>u for update
           ------------->V for verbos to get detailed view
           ------------->-i for interactive asks to overwrite?
Mv -u important junk docs------>updates files to a directory.

===============================
	rm -r docs ----deletes directory with files in it.

	Rm -r * ------- to remove every directory.

Redirecting and Appending:
==================================
0 -----------------standard input
1 -----------------standard output
2 -----------------standard error

Ex’s:
1.Ls 2> error > output
Cat error
Ntg
Cat output


2.ls 2 >> error >output
Cat error ---no file/directory
Cat output—ntg
 
3. ls 2 >> error 1> output
Cat output

Redirecting standard error and standard output into same file?
Sol:  ls > output 2>&1
Cat output

Note:

Redirecting standard error to standard output.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
