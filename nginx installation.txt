3.Go on to the downloads, right click & open Gitbash.
4. type the command ls -l *.pem to know the list of pem files which you have downloaded.
5. we use the command ssh -l pemfile ec2-user@public-ip to launch an instance.
6. after connecting to an instance switch to root user by using a command --- sudo su -
6. whoami command is used to check whether you are in ec2 or local.
7. To install nginx in ec2 we use a command as-sudo yum install nginx -y
