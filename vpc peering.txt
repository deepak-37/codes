steps for vpc peering:
================
create two vpc's (for two regions or for one region) first region:10.0.0.0/16 and second region:10.1.0.0/16
note: cidr for both vpc's should not be same.
create public subnet in 1st vpc of a particular region.
create private/public subnet in 2nd vpc of a particular region.
create igw and attach it to first vpc in first region.
create igw and attach it to second vpc in second region.
create peering connection from origin and accept it on another destinated region.
create route tables and add public subnet in public subnet associations and attach the peering connection with peer id and anywhere with igw id.
create route tables and add private subnet in public subnet associations and attach the peering connection with peer id and anywhere with igw id.
create 2 ec2's in two regions with custom vpc .
firstly,connect to the first region's server and copy the second ec2 pem by using a new client , in that client less xxxxxx.pem and copy it on the ssh client to copy and provide permissions like chmod xxxx.pem and lastly connec to the private server of the second region.
